An open-source library for establishing remote rendering resource streaming in javascript.

Increasing resource requirements of client side rendering can mean complex and innovative rendering is simply unachievable. Although the Web Audio API has provided native processing speed, concurrent audio channel mixing and processing can still put large demands on the devices network connectivity, CPU usage and memory usage. 

This issue is further compounded when OS level power management and security measures kick in, especially on mobile devices. The clientâ€™s browser is not always the best place to render audio.
